## Status

**Nitrogen** is currently in **beta** version.

---

## Description

**Nitrogen** is an Open Source CLI Ethereum Smart Contract event listener and exporter made with NodeJS.

Basically it just listens on events (from the past - if you want - and future) and exports them into an `export.json` file containing an array of events.

In the next future releases we want to add the following features:
- [ ] Allow users to save the configuration 
- [ ] Multiple Smart Contracts listening
- [ ] Customizable filename export
- [ ] Customizable export format (i.e. .xlsx, .csv)

---

## Install

In order to install Nitrogen you need to run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @cidaro/nitrogen
```

---

## Usage

Nitrogen is really easy to use: just run the `nitrogen` command in the terminal and respond to the questions!
